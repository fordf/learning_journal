No longer are our view handlers reading straight from fully built individual html pages, now we build those pages as templates and fill in the relevant, requested data. This learning journal for instance. We build the unique data into dictionaries which jinja2 looks through and inserts into templates, and voila a fully built view. And, I haven't gotten to it yet, but we'll have to fully test our views now, with help from pyramid's dummyrequest and webtests TestApp. On top of that we briefly learned about binary heaps and then were asked to implement one. The easy method is to use a python list composition thing, and indeed we used that method. However, I wouldn't call it easy, though it was enjoyable to figure out. ALSO, we chose our projects.

We discussed the tools Pyramid gives you to implement MVC architecture, with view controllers and routes. Setting up the pyramid framework is quite straightforward with the scaffolds they provide, I imagine it'd be horrendous if those weren't available. For now, all of our content is static, but we'll be building our data off of templates soon. After setting up the pyramid app, we pushed it to heroku. As our daily data structure, we were introduced to double ended queses, deques, which allow popping and appending on both ends. They werer simple to implement using the double-linked list under the hood.",
